# Spec: maintenance

## Purpose

Define the Layer-0 operational machinery: the literate meta-script format, the
render/reconcile GitOps pattern, and all deterministic scripts that automate vault
maintenance.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Literate Meta-Script Format

Every operational artifact SHALL be stored as a literate meta-script note in
`99-Operations/scripts/`: a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter describing where
it deploys and when it runs, plus a `## Rationale` section and a single fenced
code block (the artifact). Layer 0 is the source of truth (INV-3); the code block
is the authoritative version of the script.

Required frontmatter fields:

```yaml
type: meta-script
deploy_target: <host path>   # absolute or ~/... path the code block renders to
runtime: cron | manual | git hook | harness hook
schedule: "<cron expression>" # required iff runtime == cron
class: script                # literal — Layer 0 holds deterministic defs only
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

#### Scenario: render deploys all scripts and reconcile confirms zero drift
- **WHEN** `vault-render.py render` is run after Phase 1
- **THEN** an executable file is produced at each `deploy_target` declared in the scripts
- **WHEN** `vault-render.py reconcile` is then run
- **THEN** it reports `ok` for all scripts (zero drift)

#### Scenario: reconcile detects but does not fix drift
- **WHEN** a deployed host script is hand-edited after render
- **THEN** `reconcile` reports `DRIFT: <target> differs from <source>`
- **THEN** reconcile does not overwrite the deployed file (INV-3)

#### Scenario: render refuses a note that breaks the single-fence rule
- **WHEN** `vault-render.py render` (or `reconcile`) encounters a meta-script note with zero or
  more than one `python|bash` code fence
- **THEN** it prints `VIOLATION: <note> has N code fences (exactly 1 required)`, renders nothing
  for that note, and the run exits `1`

### Requirement: Deterministic Scripts Are Offline (INV-6)

All `[script]` operations MUST make no network calls and no LLM calls. They are
model-agnostic and will produce the same output given the same inputs regardless
of what AI tools are installed. This is a hard invariant; scripts that would
require network access are `[agent]` operations, not scripts.

#### Scenario: A deterministic script makes no network or LLM call
- **WHEN** any `[script]` operation runs
- **THEN** it completes using only local filesystem and Git operations
- **THEN** it issues no network request and invokes no model

### Requirement: One Mutation, One Commit (INV-2)

Every automated mutation SHALL end in exactly one Git commit with a structured message.
No script produces zero commits (silent no-op on unchanged state is acceptable;
producing zero commits when a mutation occurred is not) or multiple commits.

**Ownership:** the script that performs a mutation commits it, scoped to exactly the files it
mutated — no script relies on a later collector to sweep its writes into someone else's commit.
Uncommitted operator working-tree content is never captured by a script commit.

Commit message format: `<verb>: <subject>` (e.g., `rollover: 2 open dig(s) → 2026-06-14`).

#### Scenario: rollover produces exactly one commit when digs exist
- **WHEN** the rollover script runs with at least one `status: dig` effort in `30-Sites/`
- **THEN** it appends wikilinks to today's daily note and produces exactly one commit

#### Scenario: rollover produces no commit when nothing changed
- **WHEN** the rollover script runs and all current digs are already in the carry-over heading
- **THEN** it exits cleanly with no commit produced

#### Scenario: A created daily note is committed by its creator
- **WHEN** the daily-note creator creates today's note
- **THEN** it produces exactly one commit (`daily: opened <date>`) containing only that note
- **WHEN** the note already exists
- **THEN** no commit is produced

#### Scenario: A banked proposal is one atomic commit
- **WHEN** the refine executor applies an approved proposal
- **THEN** it produces exactly one commit (`bank: <stem>`) containing the knowledge note, the
  appended Catalog index links, and the consumed proposal's deletion (when the proposal was
  tracked) — and nothing else

#### Scenario: A close seals with a scoped commit, never a sweep
- **WHEN** `vault-close-day.py` seals a day while unrelated uncommitted changes exist elsewhere
  in the working tree
- **THEN** the close commit contains exactly the sealed daily note (plus the consumed worklist
  sidecar when git tracked it), and the unrelated changes remain uncommitted and untouched

### Requirement: Script Inventory

The following scripts SHALL be implemented as literate meta-script notes in Phase 1–2.
Each is offline and deterministic (INV-6).

| Script note | Deploy target | Runtime | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `render-reconcile-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-render.py` | manual | Deploy Layer-0 code blocks to host targets; detect drift |
| `daily-note-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-daily-note.py` | cron `1 0 * * *` | Create today's daily note from Mold; idempotent; commits the created note (`daily: opened <date>`) |
| `knowledge-lint-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-lint.py` | manual / pre-commit | Validate Treasury frontmatter and name conformance |
| `treasury-orphan-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-orphans.py` | manual / weekly | Report Treasury notes not linked from any Catalog index |
| `ore-detect-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-refine-detect.py` | cron daily | Queue ore whose grade cleared the Sort gate |
| `bank-execute-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-refine-execute.py` | manual | Apply approved proposals from `_refine-approved/`; writes Treasury; one atomic commit per banked proposal (`bank: <stem>`) |
| `spoil-dump-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-dump.sh` | manual | Move a spent husk to `71-Spoil/`; one commit |
| `site-slag-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-slag.sh` | manual | Move an uneconomic effort to `70-Tailings/`; one commit |
| `tailings-reprospect-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-reprospect.py` | manual | List slagged efforts for re-evaluation; detection only |
| `dig-rollover-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-rollover.py` | cron `2 0 * * *` | Append open dig carry-overs to today's daily note; gated on prior day `closed` |
| `daily-close-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-close-day.py` | manual | Disposition every item of a daily, write the `## Close` manifest, set `closed:`; emits the `unknown/other` worklist; seals with a scoped commit (daily + consumed sidecar), never a sweep |
| `kanban-render-script.md` | `~/bin/vault-kanban-render.py` | manual | Render read-only Markdown Kanban board |
| `naming-rules-script.md` | `~/bin/vault_naming.py` | manual | Naming validator SSOT; also emits `naming-rules.json` |
| `vault-lib-script.md` | `~/bin/vault_lib.py` | manual | Shared fleet plumbing: root resolution, config vocabulary, frontmatter access, scoped one-commit helper, fleet exit-code contract (ADR-0023) |
| `commit-gate-script.md` | `99-Operations/hooks/pre-commit` | git hook | Commit-gate: block non-conforming file names (INV-11) |
| `outbound-publish-guard-script.md` | `.claude/hooks/outbound-publish-guard.py` | harness hook | Claude Code `PreToolUse` guard (INV-14, ADR-0018): hard-deny vault-outward commands; loud ASK before public publishes — now render/reconcile-governed (R8) |
| `push-guard-script.md` | `99-Operations/hooks/pre-push` | git hook | Push-gate (INV-14): deny outbound push by default; permit a remote in `PUSH_ALLOWLIST` (full vault); for a remote in `PUBLIC_REMOTE_ALLOWLIST`, permit **only** paths matched by `99-Operations/schemas/publish-manifest.json` (`public_allow`), else refuse |

The **note filenames** follow the `silo-section-descriptor` naming convention (silo first, `script`
trailing). **Deploy targets are unchanged.** The `commit-gate` and `push-guard` hooks are deterministic
(INV-6): they read git state, `config.env`, and (for `push-guard`) the language-neutral
`publish-manifest.json` schema only — no network, no LLM.

The **`publish-manifest.json`** schema (`99-Operations/schemas/`) is a language-neutral, default-deny
allowlist of publishable framework paths, consumed by `push-guard-script` and by any future
public-export/mirror tool.

Sibling scripts import the shared modules (`vault_naming`, `vault_lib`) from `~/bin` via
`sys.path.insert(0, str(pathlib.Path.home() / "bin"))`; the underscore module names mark
importable libraries (the `vault_naming` precedent).

#### Scenario: Daily note creator is idempotent
- **WHEN** the daily-note creator runs twice on the same day
- **THEN** the note is created on the first run and `exists` is printed on the second; no duplicate is created

#### Scenario: Push-guard denies an un-allowlisted push
- **WHEN** `git push` runs from a deployed vault and the target remote URL is not listed in `PUSH_ALLOWLIST` or `PUBLIC_REMOTE_ALLOWLIST`
- **THEN** the `pre-push` hook aborts the push (non-zero) with an INV-14 message

#### Scenario: Push-guard applies the path-level manifest to a public remote
- **WHEN** `git push` targets a remote in `PUBLIC_REMOTE_ALLOWLIST` and the diff includes a path not in `publish-manifest.json` `public_allow`
- **THEN** the `pre-push` hook aborts with an INV-14 path-boundary violation; a push whose paths are all allowlisted is permitted

### Requirement: Runbook Format

A runbook SHALL be a literate, schema-validated procedure note in `96-Runbooks/` that is the
**single, harness-agnostic source of truth** for a repeatable operation. Its frontmatter
carries `id`, `title`, `trigger`, `applies-to` (`vault`|`repo`|`both`), `class`, and
`last-validated`; its body carries the required sections Purpose, Preconditions, Steps,
Pitfalls, Verification, and Rollback. Deterministic steps MUST reference meta-scripts rather
than restate them; AI MUST be invoked only where a step is genuine interpretation, narrowed
to an `unknown/other` fallback over an enumerated state list. Harness files (`CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, tool-specific skills) are adapters that point at the runbook and MUST NOT
duplicate it.

#### Scenario: runbook-lint validates a runbook
- **WHEN** `runbook-lint` runs on a `96-Runbooks/*.md` file
- **THEN** it exits 0 only if the required frontmatter keys and body sections are all present, and exits 1 otherwise

#### Scenario: A runbook is harness-agnostic
- **WHEN** the canonical runbook file is read
- **THEN** it contains no tool-specific invocation as its source of truth (any Claude Code / Hermes specifics live in adapter files that reference it)

---

### Requirement: Daily Close Lifecycle

A daily note SHALL pass a deterministic `daily-close` ritual that assigns every item exactly
one disposition from the controlled `DISPOSITIONS` vocabulary
(`claim site crucible banked slagged spoiled realized recorded passover`) and records the
result in an appended `## Close` manifest, then sets the `closed:` frontmatter to the close
date. The ritual MUST preserve **append-only** (no item above `## Close` is edited or
removed), **total-disposition** (no untagged item), and **strict-order close** (day N+1 may
not be closed while day N is open). Capture MUST always have a home — the next day's stub is
created unconditionally — but **advancing** (rollover / carry-over) is gated on the prior day
being `closed`. The deterministic engine `vault-close-day.py` (`[script]`, INV-6, no LLM)
classifies by rule and **emits an `unknown/other` worklist** for an agent or human to resolve;
it never calls a model itself.

#### Scenario: A closed day is fully dispositioned
- **WHEN** `vault-close-day.py` finalizes a day
- **THEN** the `## Close` manifest accounts for every item, `closed:` is set to the close date, and `close-lint` exits 0

#### Scenario: Advancing is gated on the prior close
- **WHEN** rollover runs and the previous day is not `closed`
- **THEN** it does not carry over, and the new day's note carries a `⚠ BLOCKED: close <prev>` banner — while the capture stub still exists

#### Scenario: An empty day auto-closes
- **WHEN** `vault-close-day.py` runs on a day with no items
- **THEN** total-disposition is trivially satisfied and the day is marked `closed` without manual input

#### Scenario: close-lint flags an out-of-vocabulary disposition
- **WHEN** `vault-close-day.py --check` runs on a sealed day whose `## Close` manifest carries a
  disposition word not in the `DISPOSITIONS` vocabulary (e.g. a typo)
- **THEN** it prints `FAIL: disposition not in vocab: <word>` and exits `1`

### Requirement: Shared Fleet Plumbing and Exit-Code Contract (vault_lib)

The maintenance fleet SHALL include a shared, deterministic library module — `~/bin/vault_lib.py`,
rendered from `vault-lib-script.md` — providing the five concerns every script previously
improvised:

- **Vault-root resolution:** `$VAULT_ROOT` is honored when it marks a vault; otherwise the root is
  found by walking up from the working directory to the first directory whose `99-Operations/`
  holds `config.defaults.env` or `config.env`. A drive-path script (one listed in the harness's
  exact-invocation exclusion list) SHALL therefore work when invoked **bare, with no pre-sourced
  environment**, from any working directory inside the vault.
- **Config vocabulary:** controlled vocabularies resolve with the precedence the shell sourcing
  order establishes — process environment > `config.env` (instance) > `config.defaults.env`
  (framework) > declared code default. Values are read as raw strings; no shell evaluation (INV-6).
- **Frontmatter access:** one YAML-typed accessor (`fm`, `is_closed`); `closed: false` or an absent
  `closed:` key is **not closed**, fleet-wide.
- **Scoped commits:** `commit_paths(vault, paths, message)` — scoped `git add` plus a
  **pathspec-scoped commit** of exactly the named paths (the INV-2 shape). It never sweeps:
  unrelated content that happens to be staged is left staged, not committed. An unchanged result
  is a **clean no-op** — an informative message, no commit, exit `0` — per the INV-2 clause that a
  silent no-op on unchanged state is acceptable while a failure is not.
- **Exit-code contract:** `0` success or clean no-op · `1` violation (lint/usage failure) ·
  `2` needs-input (a worklist was emitted) · `3` gate-blocked. A script whose run is refused by an
  operational gate (missing precondition, strict-order guard) SHALL exit `3` and print a
  `BLOCKED:` line — never `0`.

Adoption: the full Python fleet is adopted — the drive-path set (`daily-close`, `daily-note`,
`dig-rollover`, `kanban-render`, `bank-execute`) plus `knowledge-lint`, `treasury-orphan`,
`tailings-reprospect`, `ore-detect`, and the `naming-rules` mirror-writer (whose `vault_lib`
import is **lazy**, inside `__main__` only, so `--check` and module import stay dependency-free
for the hooks). The shell pair (`site-slag`, `spoil-dump`) conforms via an inline
bash copy of the root-resolution contract (bash cannot import the Python module), INV-11 slug
validation through `vault_naming.py --check`, source/destination gates (`BLOCKED`, exit 3), and
pathspec-scoped commits of exactly the moved effort — never `add -A`. **Bootstrap exception:** `render-reconcile-script` deploys `vault_lib.py`
itself and therefore SHALL NOT import it; it carries an inline copy of the root-resolution
contract instead.

**The bare-drive guarantee extends through governance hooks:** a git hook fired by a drive-path
commit (the `core.hooksPath` commit-gate, and any future hook on that path) SHALL NOT require a
pre-sourced environment. A hook that needs the vault root SHALL derive it from its git context
(e.g. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — a hook always runs inside the repository), never from the
caller's environment.

#### Scenario: A drive-path script runs bare with no pre-sourced environment
- **WHEN** a rendered drive-path script is invoked by its bare exact form (e.g.
  `~/bin/vault-kanban-render.py`) from a shell with no `VAULT_ROOT` set, cwd inside the vault
- **THEN** it resolves the vault root via the config marker walk and completes normally
- **WHEN** the same invocation happens with no `VAULT_ROOT` and cwd outside any vault
- **THEN** it prints a `BLOCKED:` line and exits `3`

#### Scenario: A gate refusal is machine-distinguishable from success
- **WHEN** the rollover script runs and the previous day is not `closed`
- **THEN** it prints `BLOCKED: previous day <date> not closed — run daily-close first` and exits `3`
- **WHEN** the rollover script runs and there is nothing to carry over
- **THEN** it exits `0`

#### Scenario: The closed test is YAML-typed and fleet-wide
- **WHEN** a prior daily note carries `closed: false` (or no `closed:` value)
- **THEN** the daily-note creator applies the `⚠ BLOCKED` banner and the rollover gate refuses —
  both via the same `vault_lib.is_closed`, with no divergence between the two scripts

#### Scenario: The shared library self-check is read-only
- **WHEN** `vault_lib.py` is executed bare inside a vault
- **THEN** it prints the resolved root and a vocabulary summary, mutates nothing, and exits `0`

#### Scenario: The commit-gate passes drive-path commits without environment
- **WHEN** a drive-path script commits its owned artifact and the `core.hooksPath` pre-commit
  naming gate fires in a process with no `VAULT_ROOT` set
- **THEN** the gate evaluates the staged names normally — INV-11 enforcement unchanged, a
  violating name is still `BLOCKED` — and does not fail on a missing environment variable

#### Scenario: A repeated render is a clean no-op
- **WHEN** a committing render script (e.g. kanban) runs twice in a row with no underlying state
  change, so the second render produces identical content
- **THEN** the second run prints an `unchanged — no commit needed` line, produces no commit, and
  exits `0` — it does not crash on an empty index

#### Scenario: A scoped commit ignores unrelated staged content
- **WHEN** unrelated files are already staged (e.g. by the operator) and a fleet script commits
  its owned artifact via `commit_paths`
- **THEN** the resulting commit contains exactly the script's named paths, and the unrelated
  staged content remains staged and uncommitted

#### Scenario: A shell mover is env-free, validated, and scoped
- **WHEN** `vault-slag.sh <slug>` runs bare with no `VAULT_ROOT`, cwd inside the vault
- **THEN** it resolves the root via the config marker walk; an invalid slug exits `1`
  (`INVALID` from the naming SSOT); a missing source or existing destination prints `BLOCKED:`
  and exits `3`; on success it produces exactly one commit containing only the moved effort,
  and unrelated staged content remains staged and uncommitted

### Requirement: Refine Executor Pre-Flight and Batch Isolation

The refine executor SHALL validate every approved proposal whole, before any write. It is the
sole automated writer of `40-Treasury/` (`bank-execute-script` → `~/bin/vault-refine-execute.py`),
and its pre-flight MUST cover:

- **Schema:** required fields present with correct types (`target_note`, `mode`, `insight_md`,
  `provenance_md`, `index_links`; `frontmatter` for `create`); unparseable JSON is a rejection,
  not a crash.
- **Containment:** the target resolves inside `40-Treasury/`; every index link resolves inside
  `40-Treasury/Catalog/`. Path escapes are rejected.
- **INV-11 boundary:** the target stem is a valid kebab slug.
- **INV-9 pre-action:** `create` SHALL NOT overwrite an existing note — a collision is a
  rejection; `append` requires the target to exist.
- **Vocabularies:** `grade` and `pillars` validate against the config SSOT (`GRADES`, `PILLARS`).
- **Link targets:** every named Catalog index file exists.
- **Catalog reachability (INV-12):** an **empty** `index_links` (a well-formed but zero-length list)
  is NOT a rejection — the executor defaults it to the holding index
  `40-Treasury/Catalog/pending-catalog-index.md` before the Containment and Link-targets checks, so
  every banked note is reachable via ≥1 Catalog index and never a silent orphan. The holding index is
  the visible *awaiting-catalog* queue (its backlog is outstanding curation work, surfaced by
  `treasury-orphan`). It is an ordinary Catalog index that MUST exist (a deployed vault ships it from
  the template); if it is absent the empty-`index_links` proposal is rejected by the Link-targets
  check like any other missing target. A *missing* or *non-list* `index_links` remains a Schema
  rejection — only an explicit empty list is defaulted.

A proposal failing any check is REJECTed with all reasons printed and **no partial write** — the
note, the index links, and the proposal file are all untouched. Rejection is **batch-isolated**:
remaining proposals are still processed. A run with any rejection exits `1` (`EXIT_VIOLATION`,
fleet contract); a fully applied (or empty) batch exits `0`. Rejected proposals remain in
`_refine-approved/` for correction — the executor never deletes what it did not bank.

#### Scenario: A malformed proposal is rejected without stopping the batch
- **WHEN** the executor runs over a batch containing an unparseable or schema-incomplete proposal
  followed by a valid one
- **THEN** the bad proposal is REJECTed with reasons, nothing of it is written, and the valid
  proposal is still banked with its atomic commit; the run exits `1`

#### Scenario: Create never overwrites refined value
- **WHEN** a `create` proposal targets a note that already exists in `40-Treasury/`
- **THEN** the proposal is REJECTed (`INV-9`) and the existing note is byte-identical afterwards

#### Scenario: A missing Catalog target rejects the whole proposal pre-write
- **WHEN** a proposal names an `index_links` entry that does not exist
- **THEN** the proposal is REJECTed and the knowledge note is NOT created — no half-applied state

#### Scenario: An empty index_links defaults to the pending-catalog holding index
- **WHEN** an approved proposal's `index_links` is an explicit empty list and
  `40-Treasury/Catalog/pending-catalog-index.md` exists
- **THEN** the executor does NOT reject it; it banks the note and links it into
  `pending-catalog-index.md` so the note is reachable (INV-12), and the note appears in the
  awaiting-catalog queue for later re-homing into its pillar index

#### Scenario: A path escape is rejected
- **WHEN** a proposal's `target_note` resolves outside `40-Treasury/` (e.g. via `..`) or an index
  link resolves outside `40-Treasury/Catalog/`
- **THEN** the proposal is REJECTed with a containment reason and nothing is written

### Requirement: Platform and Dependency Floors

The fleet SHALL declare and honor explicit floors, so implementers and future models never guess:

- **Python ≥ 3.12** (CI exercises 3.12 and 3.13); language features beyond the floor are not used.
- **Sole third-party dependency: `python-frontmatter`**, installed in the vault-local venv. The
  hook-critical paths — the git hooks, `vault_naming.py --check`, and `vault_lib`'s root/config
  helpers — MUST remain stdlib-only so they run on the system Python without the venv.
- **Platform floor: Linux/POSIX.** Bash hooks, executable bits, and POSIX path semantics are
  assumed; Windows is an explicit non-goal (documented, not silently broken).

#### Scenario: Hook-critical paths run without the venv
- **WHEN** the pre-commit naming gate or `vault_naming.py --check` runs on a system Python with
  no third-party packages installed
- **THEN** it completes normally — no `frontmatter` (or other third-party) import is reached on
  that path

#### Scenario: A new third-party dependency is a governed decision
- **WHEN** a change proposes any import beyond the standard library and `python-frontmatter`
- **THEN** it names the dependency in its proposal and updates this requirement — silent
  dependency growth is a violation
